# MDC Tests and Exercises #
This is a gathering of exercises proposed for the intent of testing my skills in logics and programming languages.

## Enunciations: ##
The Test is composed by 8 exercises. The exercises's enunciations are the following:

1. Exercise 1: Simple Calculator
Create a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and returns the result
of the operation.

2. Exercise 2: Prime Numbers
Write a function that checks whether a number is prime or not. Then create a program that
prints the first 10 prime numbers.

3. Exercise 3: Factorial
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. Next, create a program that allows the
user to enter a number and displays the corresponding factorial.

4. Exercise 4: Palindrome
Create a function that checks whether a word is a palindrome (that is, whether it reads the
same backwards and forwards). The program must ask the user for a word and inform
whether or not it is a palindrome.

5. Exercise 5: Table
Create a program that receives a number from the user and displays the table of that
number, from 1 to 10.

6. Exercise 6: Vowel Counter
Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a string. The program should ask the
user for a sentence and display how many vowels it has.

7. Exercise 7: Grade Average
Create a program that takes a student's grades in three different subjects and calculates the
average of the grades. Then display the calculated average.

8. Exercise 8: Interest Calculation
Create a function that calculates the final value of an investment based on initial capital,
interest rate, and investment time (in months). The program must prompt the user for these
values and display the final value.

## Languages used: ##
The test is for an opportunity as a PHP developer, but, as I have interest in work with Python, as well, 
I choose to use Python in half of the exercises. The other half is written in PHP.

## Requirements: ##
- PHP 7+
- Python 3

## Running the scripts: ##
To execute the exercises written in PHP, from a CLI, go to the root directory of this gathering and run:
```bash
php {nameOfTheExerciseFile}.php
```

To execute the exercises written in Python, from a CLI, go to the root directory of this gathering and run:
```bash
python3 {nameOfTheExerciseFile}.py
```
## Furthermore: ##
I wrote these scripts using the VSCode IDE, on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04, with PHP 7.4 and Python 3.8 installed on the host.
I didn't use docker nor any kind of encapsulated environment or virtualization. I haven't tested the scripts in other OS.
